Define a class Anagram with an initializer method that takes a word argument and creates a sorted version of the word as an attribute calles sorted_word.
Define a method match that takes a list of the possible anagrams as an argument.
Inside the match method, use a list comprehension to create a list that contains only the anagrams in possible_anagrams that have the same sorted letters as the original word.
In the list comprehension, use the sorted function to sort the letters of each possible anagram and compare it to the sorted_word attribute of the Anagram instance.
Return the list of matching anagrams.
